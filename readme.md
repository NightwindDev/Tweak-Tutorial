# How Do You Create a Tweak?

1. Assure that you have <a href="https://github.com/theos/theos">**Theos**</a> set up. The instructions to set up Theos can be found here: https://github.com/theos/theos/wiki/Installation. Please choose the appropriate operating system in the wiki and install it.

2. To begin creating a tweak, run the command `$THEOS/bin/nic.pl`. If this does not work, you have probably set up Theos incorrectly. Please go back to step 1 and fix your installation.
